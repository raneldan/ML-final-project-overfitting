# Mini-Batch Neural-Network for MNIST in Python with Numpy
Vanilla neural network which trains on MNIST handwritten digits. This is based on Andrew Ng's course on machine learning, just implemented in python. Gets around 90% accuracy after ~35 epochs on default hyperparameters. 

Libraries needed: numpy, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib (only if plotting)
